# Akathon contest: Game e-commerce website "Kirito" - backend part

The objective of our project is to develop a comprehensive and user-friendly website that serves as a platform for gamers to purchase games. We have focused on creating an intuitive and interactive website design that allows gamers to easily navigate through the platform and make their desired game purchases. Our specialty lies in the unique homepage design, which utilizes a window-based system where each new page opens in a separate window, setting it apart from other conventional websites. Additionally, we have incorporated the use of a nonSQL database technology, which provides nearly real-time functionality and scalability.
